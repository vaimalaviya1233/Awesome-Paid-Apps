# Awesome-Paid-Apps
This Repository contains Apps mainly paid-apps which most of are one time paid apps which are useful to me. Hopefully someone in need of such apps might find find here. whether be the payment from upfront like when installing like paid app on google play or be in-app purchase, I will only include apps those have these types of apps. Another thing to note is there might be apps where it was originally one-time payment app then later changed to subscription model however they did offered lifetime premium benefits to those who did pay them when it was in its early stages. I am not here to judge the payment model whether be it one-time-payment or subscription however I prefer one-time payment apps however considering today's inflation app makers(individual developer) are in need to change to subscription with no more of my nonsense will leave you to discover new apps.

##### New and rising app that are really good and effective in productivity even if it might seems like nothing yet but those are the rising stars, these rising stars need support especially if they come from individual developers. 

I am Android enthusiast so some of the apps might not be sutable for regular/normal user such as android development apps.
Many and most of these app will be for android platform however there might be some desktop software that is really cool üòé. 

Feel free to make PR to add new apps, I will merge PR(pull request) once I have reviewed the PR request.

[FilterBox- Notification Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catchingnow.np) - IAP/Free - It seems like this app is naturally born by developer by keeping only one motive in the mind "Manage the all notifications". App developer even added AI feature that works on mobile offline, so no privacy problems there however sad to see other devices losing support because some devices can't run that AI so making whole app not avaliable to install from google play store. (checkout other apps from same dev those are great too such as IceBox...etc)

(dev - just know that your app is so unique that out of 2.43 million apps your app is the only one that gives experiences of programmer that one can find no where in world.)
[Skit Premium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pavelrekun.skit.premium) - Paid/Free - what can i say "I like good app managers", though it refreshes app list everytime you uninstall app which is not great when you have app list sorted by size(I have having to wait while it recalculates and sorts app everytime i uninstall one app)(dev - please fix the problem i listed above except that you have 5 stars for your every app)

[Tiny Scanner Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appxy.tinyscan) - Paid - This app was great. except when they later changed to subscription model and created whole new app and kept their focus on that app to adding new features and this app got no feature updates at all. Honestly dare I say shame on developers like you who only likes money. even App developer who has 1 million downloads and still have app in paid and not have subscription and on top of it he is losing and still he even provides updates to that app "Tasker". I could go write essay on how money gets developers greedy so much. but since we are here to discover awesome paid app not subscription app from devs like Beesoft apps, i won't let you all reader feel the wrath that I have been holding against devs like those greedy once. lets move on.
[Volume Scheduler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bhanu.volumeschedulerpro) - Paid/Free - This developer has been making great and useful apps that are needed in our daily life like he was made for the seating job of developer. You are great you hear me dev.üëçüßë‚Äçüíª
[Writer's Dictionary - Offline](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bewtechnologies.writersdictionary) - Paid - This app has been so much useful that even great vocabulary websites can't find words that are in this app and dare I say those words are great when it comes to writing. I would even say this is one of the underrated apps only 100+ downloads. I say there are not many writers with even low money as $0.98 man oh man writing community died or they are great it seems.(check out other apps from same dev those are great too)
